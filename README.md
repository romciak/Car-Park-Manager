# Car-Park-Manager

Car-Park-Manager was created as a team project at the Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University in Brno.

It's an application, which keeps records of vehicles in an imaginary company. It allows to define service checks to each car, to manage employees, to keep records of every drive done by an employee including some details (duration, kilometers etc.) and so on. In conclusion, it emulates a situation in a imaginary car park company.

It's a multi-tiered application developed in Java. Modern technologies like Spring, REST API, AngularJS etc. are used.

## Information for the REVIEWERS of the 2nd milestone

Since we recently lost a team member, seminar tutor allowed us to reduce a funcionality, therefore we implemented and tested only 1 non-trivial function.
